        About the Legend
      </h1>



      <p>
        ☛ Lata Mangeshkar, also known as the <strong>'Nightingale of India'</strong>,
        was one of the most versatile singers in the Indian film industry.
        Lata was born on September 28, 1929, to classical singer and theatre
        artist Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar and Shevanti in Indore, Madhya Pradesh.<br><br>
        ☛ Her father started teaching her music at an early age. By the time she was five,
        Lata was seen participating as an actress in plays written by her father. Her siblings
        - Meena, Asha, Usha, and Hridaynath - are all accomplished singers and musicians.<br><br>
        ☛ In a career spanning nearly eight decades, Lata Mangeshkar was the singing voice for
        a bevy of Bollywood leading ladies. She lent her voice to over 5,000 songs in over
        a thousand Hindi and 36 regional films. She had an unprecedented impact on Indian
        film music. Since 1942, Lata pushed back the boundaries of music with her mind-boggling skills.
        Over the years, Lata had sung for actresses from Madhubala to Priyanka Chopra.
        Best known for her versatile voice quality, she recorded albums of all kinds (ghazals, pop, etc)..
        <br><br> ☛ In 1942, her father's untimely death put the onus of providing for the family on her shoulders.
        Pandit Deenanath's friend Master Vinayak took care of the Mangeshkar family and offered her a role in the film
        Badi Maa.
        In 1949, she moved to Bombay (now Mumbai), where she began learning Hindustani music from Ustad Aman Ali Khan.
        <br><br> ☛ Lata had worked with several legendary music directors including Madan Mohan,
        R D Burman, the duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal and A R Rahman. She teamed up with Madan Mohan for the 1960s like
        Aap Ki Nazron Ne Samjha from Anpadh, Lag Jaa Gale and Naina Barse Rim Jhim from Woh Kaun Thi?. Lata had sung
        over 700 songs for Laxmikant-Pyarelal, which include Mere Naseeb Mein from Naseeb and Sheesha Ho Ya Dil Ho from
        Asha.
        <br><br> ☛ Lata sang R D Burman’s first and last songs – in Chote Nawaab (1961) and Kuch Na Kaho in 1942: A Love
        Story in 1994. Her collaborations with A R Rahman resulted in popular songs like Luka Chupi in Rang de Basanti
        (2006) and O Paalanhaare in the movie, Lagaan (2001).
        <br><br> ☛ From Pyar Kiya To Darna Kya from Mughal-e-Azam (1960) to Ajeeb Dastaan Hai Yeh, from Dil Apna Aur
        Preet Parai (1960) to Rangeela Re from Prem Pujari (1970) or even Jiya Jale in Dil Se, the singer had lent her
        voice to a number of timeless classics over the years.
        <br><br> ☛ In 2012, Lata Mangeshkar launched her own music label called LM Music. Her most recent release (March
        2019) was the song Saugandh Mujhe Is Mitti Ki, composed by Mayuresh Pai, which is a tribute to the Indian army
        and India.
        <br><br> ☛ Lata Mangeshkar received several awards and accolades during her eight-decade-long career. In 1974,
        she became the first Indian to perform at the Royal Albert Hall. She is the recipient of <b>three</b> National
        Film Awards, <b>15</b> Bengal Film Journalists' Association Awards, four Filmfare Best Female Playback Awards,
        two Filmfare Special Awards, Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award and many more. Lata Mangeshkar was bestowed
        with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 1989.
        <br><br> ☛ Along with these, Lata Mangeshkar held the distinction of being the most recorded artist in the
        history of Indian music in Guinness Record in 1974. The Indian government honoured her with the Daughter of the
        Nation award on her 90th birthday in September 2019.
        <br><br> ☛ The book entitled "Lata Mangeshkar: A Musical Journey" contains little known facts intertwined with
        the story of her life in music, struggles, successes and her reign as the Queen of Hindi music from the 1940s to
        the present day.
        <br><br> ☛ On November 11, 2019 Lata Mangeshkar was admitted to the Breach Candy Hospital, in South Mumbai after
        she complained of difficulty in breathing. According to latest reports, while she is recovering gradually, her
        condition remains critical.
